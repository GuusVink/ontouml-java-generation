# TestCodeGeneration

Plain Java project that is used to test code generated by the [UML2Java transformation](../nl.guusgrievink.ontouml.implementationmodel.gen.java/readme.md).
Code should be generated in the src folder (which is .gitignored).
An ANT task is provided to compile the generated code to check wheter the code contains syntactical errors.

Furthermore, the ANT task provides a `clear-source-files` targets that can be used to 
remove the generated code, which is used by the automated validation process that generates code
for multiple projects.


## Code for manual validation

[code-for-manual-validtion](code-for-manual-validation) contains the Java code that was generated with the goal to manually validate the transformation.
The process of this manual validation is described in the related master's thesis.
