# UML to Java generation

Acceleo project to generate Java code from UML2 models.
Derived from the non-active [UML-Java-Generation](https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Java-Generation) project by Obeo.

This project is adjusted in several ways:
- Now uses [UML2 5.0.0 EMF metamodel](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdt.uml2)
- Updated to use Acceleo version 3.7.17
- Fixed numerous bugs
- Added functionality for Interface attributes
