# OntoUML Ecore metamodel

This project contains the OntoUML Ecore Metamodel.
The [readOntoUML.java](src/nl/guusgrievink/emf/ontouml/model/readOntoUML.java) class contains
code to create an instance of an OntoUML Ecore model.
The code requires the path to an OntoUML JSON file as well as a path (ending in .xmi) that 
indicates where the XMI should be stored.
These paths can either be set in the code, or gives as CLI arguments.
